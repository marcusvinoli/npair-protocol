## nPair Protocol

The nPair Protocol is a simple way to exchange data and commands over a Serial interface, when working with a microcontroller and a host PC.

The basic working principle is a pair of an address number and typed value.

To prevent the microcontroller RAM overusing only the payload is saved on the buffer (which is also shared for transmitting and receiving data).
